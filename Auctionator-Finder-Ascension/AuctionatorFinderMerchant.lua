-- FINDER: merchant (NPC / Bazaar) scanning -------------------------------------
--
-- Opening a vendor used to fire off TWO independent harvests -- the NPC
-- trade-good price learner (here, moved out of AuctionatorHints.lua) and the
-- Bazaar token learner (Atr_Bz_HarvestMerchant, still in AuctionatorBazaar.lua)
-- -- and BOTH ran again on every MERCHANT_UPDATE.  The client refires
-- MERCHANT_UPDATE in a burst while item data streams in, so a single vendor
-- open re-walked the whole merchant list many times over; that is what made
-- opening an NPC stutter.
--
-- This file is the single, gentle entry point for both:
--
--   * ONE event frame, shared by both harvests, that DEBOUNCES the update
--     storm down to a single pass a beat after the updates go quiet, and
--   * a session THROTTLE (Fdr_ScanThrottle_*) keyed on a fingerprint of the
--     merchant's list, so re-opening a vendor already learned this session --
--     or a late stray update for it -- costs only two link reads, not a walk.
--
-- Vendor stock does not change within a session, so "already scanned this
-- vendor" is a safe skip.  A different Bazaar gossip branch is a different list
-- (different items, so a different fingerprint) and is still scanned once each.
-- The mark is only set when the list was fully populated, so a scan taken while
-- the list was still filling in is retried on the next quiet update.

-- Local translation passthrough (the Bazaar's BZT is file-local over there).
local function MZT (s)
	if (ZT) then return ZT (s); end
	return s;
end

-- FINDER_TAB: NPC (vendor-bought) trade-good prices -----------------------
-- Some crafting reagents are bought FROM an NPC at a fixed price and sold in
-- unlimited supply -- Empty Vial, Crystal Vial, Wooden Stock, thread, flux,
-- dyes, spices, and so on.  For those the going cost is the NPC price, not
-- whatever someone happens to relist them for on the AH, and their auction
-- number just misleads the crafting-cost maths.
--
-- We can't ask the client "is item X sold by a vendor"; that's only knowable
-- while a merchant window is open (GetMerchantItemInfo).  So we LEARN it: any
-- Trade Goods item a merchant offers at UNLIMITED stock for a plain gold price
-- is recorded in AUCTIONATOR_NPC_PRICES (account-wide) as itemID -> per-item
-- NPC buy price.  Presence in that table is exactly "this trade good is
-- normally sold by NPCs", and the value is its NPC price.  Coverage grows as
-- vendors are visited; nothing here needs a curated item list.
--
-- Note the deliberate naming: the addon already says "Vendor" for the price an
-- NPC pays YOU (the sell value from GetItemInfo).  This is the other
-- direction -- what you PAY an NPC to buy it -- so it is called the NPC price
-- throughout, never "vendor".

-- Walk the open merchant and learn every unlimited-stock, gold-priced Trade
-- Goods item as an NPC-sold reagent.  Limited-stock or item/honor-cost slots

--
-- Returns  stored, warm  where `warm` is false if any merchant slot had no item
-- link yet (the list is still populating).  The scheduler uses `warm` to decide
-- whether to lock this merchant out of re-scanning for the session, so a scan
-- taken before the list finished filling in is retried rather than frozen.
